The Internet of Samples (iSamples) is a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional project funded by the National Science Foundation to design, develop, and promote service infrastructure to uniquely, consistently, and conveniently identify material samples, record metadata about them, and persistently link them to other samples and derived digital content, including images, data, and publications.

# Objectives

<Typography variant="body1" color="textPrimary">

1. Design and develop iSamples infrastructure (iSamples in a Box and iSamples Central);
2. Build four initial implementations of iSamples for adoption and use case testing (Open Context, GEOME, SESAR, and Smithsonian Institution);
3. Conduct outreach and community engagement to developers, individual researchers, and international organizations concerned with material samples.
